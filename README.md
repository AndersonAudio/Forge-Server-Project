# The Forge Server Project 🔧🔥

Where iron meets innovation. Built to create, defend, and dominate.

---

## 💡 Project Vision

The Forge began as a private cybersecurity and IAM lab. It has evolved into a self-hosted AI innovation hub designed to:

- Reinforce CompTIA Security+ knowledge through real builds
- Practice IAM workflows (Okta, AD, SailPoint)
- Integrate local AI models for automation, defense, and translation
- Launch real monetizable AI tools (Om-Call Translator)

This is no longer just a study box. It's the blueprint for building technology-powered freedom.

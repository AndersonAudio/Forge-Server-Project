# Forge Server Project 🔧🔥

Welcome to the Forge—where iron meets insight.

This project documents the full lifecycle of building a private cybersecurity and AI lab using my personal workstation. The Forge Server is designed to power my CompTIA Security+ studies, IAM practice (Okta, SailPoint, AD), and hands-on learning with AI tools like Ollama and Meetily.

---

## 🛠️ Objectives

- Reinforce Security+ concepts through real-world builds
- Practice IAM principles in a safe, controlled environment
- Integrate local AI models to support cybersecurity workflows
- Secure the lab using VPN, firewalls, and access controls
- Document every technical detail for portfolio and hiring visibility

---

## 💻 Hardware Specs

> See [`hardware-specs.md`](hardware-specs.md)

- Intel Core i5 (4th Gen)
- NVIDIA RTX 2060 (12GB VRAM)
- 32GB DDR3 RAM (maximum supported)
- 500GB SSD (primary and only connected drive)

---

## 🧠 Tools & Platforms

> See [`software-tools.md`](software-tools.md)

- **Ollama** – Local AI model runner
- **Meetily** – Meeting transcription and AI assistant
- **Active Directory** – Simulated IAM provisioning
- **Okta / SailPoint** – Documentation and IAM concept modeling
- **OpenVPN / WireGuard** – VPN access for secure remote entry and IAM simulation

---

## 🧙‍♂️ AI Integration Plan

> See [`local-AI-plan.md`](local-AI-plan.md)

This lab will eventually serve as an AI-hosted meeting space to simulate IAM coordination between systems, using prompts, automation tools, and transcription services.

## 🛡️ Security Infrastructure

> See [`vpn-setup.md`](vpn-setup.md)

- VPN gateway for remote and secured access
- Planned: local firewall rules and event logging
- Optional: integrate VPN logs into SIEM for monitoring practice

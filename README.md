# 🔧🔥 The Forge Server Project  
**Where iron meets innovation. Built to create, defend, and dominate.**

---

## 💡 Project Vision  
Originally launched as a private cybersecurity and IAM lab, the Forge has evolved into a self-hosted innovation hub supporting:

- Real-world reinforcement of **CompTIA Security+** concepts  
- Simulation of **IAM workflows** (Okta, SailPoint, AD, MFA, SSO)  
- Deployment of local **AI agents** for automation, monitoring, and language translation  
- Creation of **monetizable AI tools** like *Om-Call Translator*

> This isn’t just a study box—it’s a blueprint for building **technology-powered independence.**

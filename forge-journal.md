## 🗓️ June 16, 2025

**Milestone Achieved:** GitHub repository launched.  
- Created `Forge-Server-Project` on GitHub
- Learned how to add new files and commit documentation
- Added and refined README with accurate system specs
- Integrated VPN, AI, and IAM plans into project scope  
**Reflection:**  
Today marks the beginning of something real. No longer just in my head—this is live, this is visible, this is mine. I’ve never done GitHub before, but I stood in the fire and walked forward anyway.

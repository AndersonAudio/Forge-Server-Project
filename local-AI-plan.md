# Local AI Integration Plan – Forge Server 🧠

This scroll defines how local AI tools will be integrated into the Forge Server to enhance cybersecurity training, IAM simulation, and daily productivity. AI is not just a tool—it is a teammate in the lab.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Host local large language models (LLMs) for secure prompt experimentation
- Simulate IT meetings, access review calls, or incident debriefings using AI transcription
- Use AI tools to document, summarize, and explain IAM processes and system changes
- Future: Explore AI-assisted log analysis or PowerShell automation

---

## 🔧 Core AI Tools

### 🧠 Ollama
- Local LLM runner (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, Codellama)
- Used for:
  - Prompt engineering practice
  - Offline, private conversations with AI
  - Writing scripts, commands, or IAM documentation

### 🗣️ Meetily
- Local AI meeting assistant
- Used for:
  - Transcribing team simulations or change reviews
  - Generating summaries from Forge session notes
  - Capturing roleplay IAM support calls or VPN access debriefs

## 📍 Planned Integrations

| Tool     | Role in Forge                           | Status         |
|----------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Ollama   | Local model experimentation & scripting  | In planning    |
| Meetily  | Meeting transcription & summaries        | Initial setup  |
| Python   | AI-enhanced automation or parsing        | Future phase   |

## 🛡️ Security Philosophy

All AI tools used in the Forge must:
- Be hosted locally or within a private network
- Never transmit logs or prompts to third parties
- Support open-source transparency where possible
- Be limited to test scenarios and offline experiments only

---

## 🔮 Future Expansion Ideas

- AI agent to simulate a Help Desk teammate (e.g., “CoPilot”)
- Use Ollama for interpreting log files or Windows Event IDs
- Transcribe Zoom calls from external training and summarize key points
- Automate IAM compliance reporting using AI text generators
